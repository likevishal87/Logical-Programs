// Perfect Number
//a. Just like the Armstrong number, the Perfect Number is also a special type of
//positive number. When the number is equal to the sum of its positive divisors
//excluding the number, it is called a Perfect Number. For example, 28 is the perfect
//number because when we sum the divisors of 28, it will result in the same number.
//The divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. So,
//b. 28 = 1+2+4+7
//c. 28 = 28
